# Secure-Chat-with-Implementation-of-AES-with-Diffie-Hellman-Key-Exchange
The motive of the project is to make a secure data transmission application with the help of Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol and
AES and study its applications especially for the internet key exchange and encryption.  Create a web page for an electronic business. 
Encipher sensitive data AES such as customer credit number, SSN etc. before transporting them from client to server.  
The idea is simple, the customer access the website powered by our simple http server, our web server will reply with a java servlet. 
The client will communicate with server by Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol to generate the common shared key which is used in 
the later communication. After key exchange, both server and client will use the shared key to encipher and decipher the 
sensitive data such as customer credit number, SSN etc.
